# Firefox Hardening Configuration

A comprehensive Firefox user.js configuration file for enhanced privacy, security, and performance, based on the Betterfox project with additional custom hardening modifications.

## Overview

This configuration applies three main optimization categories:

- **FastFox**: Performance optimizations
- **SecureFox**: Security enhancements
- **PeskyFox**: UI/UX improvements

Plus additional custom hardening for enhanced privacy protection.

## Installation

### Method 1: Direct Access via Firefox

1. Open Firefox and type `about:profiles` in the address bar
2. Find your current profile (marked as "This is the profile in use")
3. Click "Open Folder" next to "Root Directory"
4. Copy the `user.js` file to this directory
5. Restart Firefox for changes to take effect

### Method 2: Manual Profile Location

1. Locate your Firefox profile directory:

   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[profile-name]`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/[profile-name]`
   - **Linux**: `~/.mozilla/firefox/[profile-name]`

2. Copy the `user.js` file to your Firefox profile directory

3. Restart Firefox for changes to take effect

üí° **Tip**: The `about:profiles` method is the easiest way to find your active profile directory without manually navigating through system folders.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Backup**: Keep a backup of your current Firefox profile before applying these changes.

## Testing Your Configuration

After applying the configuration:

1. Visit `about:config` to verify settings are applied
2. Test your most-used websites for compatibility
3. Check privacy protection at [Cover Your Tracks](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/)
4. Verify fingerprinting protection at [AmIUnique](https://amiunique.org/)

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues:

1. **Website breaks**: Try disabling RFP temporarily or add site to exceptions
2. **Performance issues**: Adjust cache settings or network limits
3. **Missing features**: Re-enable specific preferences as needed
